# Tidy data

## Standing-Katz chart
\fullwidth{standing-katz-plot}

## What is not tidy data
\fullwidth{zfactor_rawdata}

## After tidying it up
\fullwidth{zfactor_tidy}


## Why is so hard to operate with untidy data

* Difficult to vectorize
* Extra steps to perform arithmetic operations
* Difficult to plot: series, facets
* Plotting doesn't scale very well
