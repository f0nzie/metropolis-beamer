This is a customized version of `metropolis` Beamer them to be used in my presentations.


## Changes from Latex to Rmarkdown

1. Created a `Rmarkdown` presentation identical to the sample in Latex
2. Created another Rmarkdown presentation from another template used in the package `binb`.
3. Add a Rmarkdown presentation using a table of contents.
3. Modify the `header.tex` to number the sections in the TOC
4. Modify the `header.tex` to allow the insertion of the theme name
5. Add a folder `demo` with the original **metropolis** demo in Latex.
6. Compile and copy the **metropolis** styles. Compilation done in Linux Mint 19.


## Folders

### `demo`
Contains the original demo `tex` file from the `metropolis` theme.

### `latex_test`
Diverse `Rnw` files to test implementations before translating to Rmarkdown.
